# 📚 FastAPI Practice – Udemy Course

This repository contains hands-on exercises and backend implementations developed while completing the Udemy course “FastAPI – The Complete Course.”
It demonstrates modern backend development using FastAPI, including authentication, database integration, async features, and real REST API design.

## 📂 Projects Overview

 This repository is organized into multiple sub-projects, each focusing on a different aspect of backend development with FastAPI and Python.

🔹 OOP-Python Refresher

 A Python refresher project focused on Object-Oriented Programming principles such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
 This module strengthens core Python skills required for writing clean and maintainable backend code.

 🔹 BasicBooksAPI (CRUD)
 
  A beginner-friendly FastAPI project that introduces core concepts such as routing, HTTP methods, and basic CRUD operations.
  It serves as a foundation for understanding how FastAPI works before moving to more advanced backend features.

🔹 AdvancedBooksAPI (CRUD)

 An advanced REST API built with FastAPI that demonstrates full CRUD operations combined with authentication, validation, and structured routing.
 This project focuses on production-style API design, JWT authentication, and clean backend architecture.

🔹 ToDoApp

A complete ToDo backend application built with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and JWT authentication.
It includes user registration, login, role-based authorization (admin/user), and full CRUD operations with database persistence.
Includes comprehensive tests for authentication, user management, and CRUD operations to ensure reliability and correctness.

## 🎯 Key Objective

The main objective of this repository is to build modern backend knowledge using FastAPI and apply practical skills such as authentication,
database modeling, error handling, async processing, and production-ready API architecture.

## 📌 Overview
  
Each module in this repository demonstrates a specific backend concept such as:

* RESTful API design
