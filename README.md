# 📚 FastAPI Practice – Udemy Course

This repository contains hands-on exercises and backend implementations developed while completing the Udemy course “FastAPI – The Complete Course.”
It demonstrates modern backend development using FastAPI, including authentication, database integration, async features, and real REST API design.

## 🎯 Key Objective

The main objective of this repository is to build modern backend knowledge using FastAPI and apply practical skills such as authentication,
database modeling, error handling, async processing, and production-ready API architecture.

## 📌 Overview
  
Each module in this repository demonstrates a specific backend concept such as:

* RESTful API design
* Authentication and authorization
* Database CRUD operations
* Routing and modular structure
* Validation with Pydantic
* Handling JSON and async requests
